DSBgo provides a library for accessing DSBmobile. Go translation for [mojansch/pydsb](https://github.com/mojansch/pydsb).

## Features
- [X] Getting plans
- [ ] Getting news
- [ ] Getting postings

Because I have no access to a DSBmobile account which utilizes the news and postings feature of DSB, I can currently not implement these features effectively. If you have one, please contact me.
